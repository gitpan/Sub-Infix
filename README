NAME
    Sub::Infix - create a fake infix operator

SYNOPSIS
       use Sub::Infix;
   
       # Operator needs to be defined (or imported) at compile time.
       BEGIN { *plus = infix { $_[0] + $_[1] } };
   
       my $five = 2 |plus| 3;

DESCRIPTION
    Sub::Infix creates fake infix operators using overloading. It doesn't use
    source filters, or Devel::Declare, or any of that magic. (Though
    Devel::Declare isn't magic enough to define infix operators anyway; I
    know; I've tried.) It's pure Perl, has no non-core dependencies, and runs
    on Perl 5.6.

    The price you pay for its simplicity is that you cannot define an operator
    that can be used like this:

       my $five = 2 plus 3;

    Instead, the operator needs to be wrapped with real Perl operators in one
    of three ways:

       my $five = 2 |plus| 3;
       my $five = 2 /plus/ 3;
       my $five = 2 <<plus>> 3;

    The advantage of this is that it gives you three different levels of
    operator precedence.

    You can also call the function a slightly less weird way:

       my $five = plus->(2, 3);

  How does it work?
    `2 |plus| 3` is parsed by perl as: `2 | ( &plus() | 3 )`.

    `&plus()` returns an object that overloads the `|` operator; let's call
    that $obj.

    The overloaded `$obj | 3` operation stashes 3 inside $obj noting that the
    number is the right operand, and returns $obj.

    Then `2 | $obj` is evaluated, stashing 2 inside $obj as the left operand.
    At this point, the object notices that it has both operands, and calls the
    coderef from the definition of the operator, passing it both operands.
